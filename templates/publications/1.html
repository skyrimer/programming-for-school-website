    <h1>Curve fitting with Python</h1>
    <article>
        <h2>The problem</h2>
        <p>As I started to do my math IA, one of the problems that appeared on my way was curve fitting. Since finding
            the guitar's precise surface area requires calculus, the only feasible way was to plot the outline using the
            points and convert those points into functions. However, none of the applications and websites that I have
            used would give me a mathematical function that would define the curve of best fit for the data set: it was
            either impossible to copy, the number of decimal places would not be enough, or the correlation coefficient
            would show an uncertain value.</p>
        <p>As a result, I created a Python script that would take a set of points and return the type of the curve, its
            parameters, and the correlation coefficient (where 1 is the ideal fit).</p>
        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>I know that math is a scary science for most of the population, so I will not go in-depth but describe what
            the script does. For it to work, I created a file where I stored a list of points I needed to get a curve.
            The reason for creating an external file was that it was easy to edit for another set of curves.</p>
        <p>When I had my points ready, I ran the script. Firstly it splits the x-coordinates and the y-coordinates into
            two separate lists and converts each number to a NumPy float. This move is essential for curve-fitting
            becauseâ€¦ I have no idea, honestly, between the regular float in Python and NumPy float but the documentation
            and other tutorials did it, and it works this way.</p>
        <p>Then comes the magic of Python. Using NumPy polift and some statistics, I found all the best-fit curves with
            polynomials from zero to nine and their correlation coefficients. Someone might ask: but what about other
            functions like reciprocal or power fits? Since I did not want to deal with complex integration techniques,
            extra functions that I checked were separated into the additional list, and the same operation was done. As
            an outcome, I had a list of curve names, their parameters, and correlation coefficients.</p>
        <p>The last thing that remained was to filter the data by its correlation and print it to the console. All of
            the mentioned above resulted in the following code:</p>

        <h2>Evaluation</h2>
        <p>I know that it is a highly narrow application of programming, yet it is an application that saved me much
            time. By making this script, I had a clear overview of how the outline acts at any segment in under seconds
            while I had room to pick the function that would have the best visual fit. Moreover, since it is done
            programmatically, the effect of human error is minimized while the precision in calculations is maximized.
        </p>
        <p>A manual alternative would mean that inserting the list of points several times would take more time than it
            took me to write the code.</p>
        <h2>Possible improvements</h2>
        <p>The room for improvement is only limited by your coding and maths skills. Finding the exact points that would
            ideally fit the outline segment still took some time. Logically speaking, I am sure it is possible to load
            all points into a file, run through the script, and then get a list of functions defining the entire guitar.
            On the other hand, it would require advanced mathematics knowledge that I do not currently have.</p>
        <p>Another improvement would be the representation. Printing the answer to a console does its function of
            communicating the result, but it could be done in a more user-friendly way using some libraries. I was too
            lazy to do it in this case, but it is still a point to consider.</p>
